# Model-Deployment-using-Flask-for-Beginners
This guide is for beginners to deploy a machine learning model using flask

The deployment of the machine learning model is rarely discussed. Most of the data science programs, online courses do not focus on model deployment. It is one of the important and last stages in the machine learning life cycle. To start using your machine learning model for practical decision-making, it needs to be effectively deployed into production. The focus of this code is to deploy a machine learning model using a flask.
